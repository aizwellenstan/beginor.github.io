[扁平化设计](http://designmodo.com/flat-design/) —— 设计社区不得不谈论的话题， 这种趋势的感觉是强烈的， 大多数设计师不能顺应这种趋势， 甚至讨厌这种趋势。

我是属于中间派， 良好的设计是创建可工作的有用的事物， 如果这么做的答案是顺应潮流的扁平化设计， 那就是它了。 但是这种趋势不能适用于所有的项目， 所以不能强制使用。

让我们先来看看是什么让事物扁平化， 它有五个很独特的特征， 我们接下来逐个介绍， 再加上对“接近”扁平化设计的介绍。

## 不添加效果

**扁平化设计**的概念来自于其自身形象，采用了非常独特的简约而扁平的设计风格。

这种概念不添加点缀——阴影、棱台、浮雕、渐变以及其它增加深度层次的工具。 所有的元素包括图像、 按钮、 导航工具， 都是非常清爽的， 没有任何羽化或者阴影效果。

不添加效果使元素看起来更加真实， 类似于在拟物化设计项目中为元素添加三维效果的技巧， 扁平化设计中使用的层也反映出那些技巧， 但是平面之间互不相交， 保留了明确的背景、前景或按钮， 文字和导航。

是设么让这种设计可行呢？ 不添加效果让扁平化设计有了一种奇特的观感， 它依赖于清晰的设计层次感和元素位置来创建成功的产品， 让用户容易理解和交互。 越来越多的网站开始采用扁平化设计原则， 它在应用和移动设计方面可能更加流行， 在小屏幕上， 更少的按钮和选项， 扁平化的界面非常容易使用。

## 简单的元素

Flat design uses many simple user interface elements, such as buttons and icons. Designers often stick to simple shapes, such as rectangles, circles or squares and allow each shape to stand alone. Shape edges can be perfectly angular and square or include curvature.

Each UI element should be simple and easy to click or tap. Interaction should be intuitive for users without a lot of in-design explanation.

In addition to simple styling, go bold with color on clickable buttons to encourage use. But don’t confuse simple elements with simple design, flat design concepts can be just as complex as any other type of design scheme.

## 关注字体

Because of the simple nature of element in flat design, typography is extremely important.

The tone of typefaces should match the overall design scheme – a highly embellished font might look odd against a super-simple design. Type should also be bold and worded simply and efficiently, in an effort for the final product to have a consistent tone visually and textually.

Consider a simple sans serif type family with plenty of variations and weights for the primary typography on a site using flat design. Add a touch of the unexpected with one novelty font as an art element, but be careful not to go overboard with use of the specialty typeface.

Type should also tell users how to use the design. Label buttons and other elements for increased ease of use and interactivity.

## 关注颜色

Color is a large part of flat design. [Flat design color palettes](http://designmodo.com/flat-design-colors/) are often much brighter and more colorful than those for other sites.

Color palettes for flat design projects often contain many more hues as well. While most color palettes focus on two or three colors at most, flat design palettes may use six to eight colors equally.

The hues tend to be vibrant – think about the purest colors from the color wheel – without tints or tones. Primary and secondary colors are popular. In addition certain types of colors are also used frequently; in this iteration of the flat design trend, retro colors – including salmon, purple, green and blue – are especially popular.

## 简约实现

Flat design is simple by nature and works well with an overall minimalist design approach.

Avoid too many bells and whistles in the overall site design. Simple color and text may be enough. If you want to add visuals, opt for simple photography.

Some retail sites, such as Svpply (above), using flat design have done a good job placing items on a simple background to do this. (It should be noted that the photos do have some natural depth but still fit into the overall flatness of the design.)

## “接近” 扁平化设计

A style more designers tend to agree on is “almost” flat design.

In almost flat design, the basic theme of the flat style is used but some effects are added to the design scheme. Buttons, for example, may contain slight gradients or drop shadows. Designers typically pick one effect and use it exclusively in an almost flat project.

This style allows for a little more flexibility than some of the rigidness of the no effects thought behind flat design.

Designers like it because of the added depth and texture. Users like it because the style is a little less sharp and can help guide proper interaction. On the flip side, designers don’t like it because it marries two styles in a way that can lack definition of a true style.
